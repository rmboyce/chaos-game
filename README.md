This simple program starts with a polygon and a point. Then, it chooses a random vertex from the polygon and moves the point halfway to that vertex.\
Controls: Press 3 - 9 to control the number of sides the polygon has, 0 to toggle whether the same vertex can be picked twice in a row (default is no).
