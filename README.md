This simple program starts with a polygon and a point. Then, it chooses a random vertex from the polygon and makes a copy of the point halfway between the old point and the vertex. Eventually, the points will make a pattern.\
Controls: Press 3 - 9 to control the number of sides the polygon has, 0 to toggle whether the same vertex can be picked twice in a row (default is no).
